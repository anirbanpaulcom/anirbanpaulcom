        'I had the pleasure of mentoring Anirban during his Google Summer of Code (GSoC) internship while we were working on the mobile project at Rocket.Chat. Anirban demonstrated exceptional technical skills, a strong work ethic, and a keen ability to tackle complex challenges. Throughout the GSoC program, Anirban was proactive in learning and applying new concepts, and he consistently delivered high-quality work. His dedication and enthusiasm were evident in every task he undertook, and his contributions significantly advanced our project. Anirbanâ€™s collaborative spirit and problem-solving capabilities make him a valuable asset to any team. I have no doubt that he will continue to excel and make meaningful contributions in his future endeavors. I highly recommend him for any role or opportunity that aligns with his skills and passions.',
